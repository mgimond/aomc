 Running model .....
 Running simulation for wavelength =    1.00000000    
     % scattered forward  =    98.11
     % scattered backward =     1.89
  mean optical pathlength =      Inf  (still experimental)
 Running simulation for wavelength =    2.00000000    
     % scattered forward  =    98.10
     % scattered backward =     1.90
  mean optical pathlength =      Inf  (still experimental)
 Done with simulation. Now computing/writing output...
 AOMC model run complete!
