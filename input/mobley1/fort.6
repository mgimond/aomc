 Running model .....
 Running simulation for wavelength =    1.00000000    
     % scattered forward  =    49.99
     % scattered backward =    50.01
  mean optical pathlength =      NaN  (still experimental)
 Running simulation for wavelength =    2.00000000    
     % scattered forward  =    50.00
     % scattered backward =    50.00
  mean optical pathlength =      NaN  (still experimental)
 Done with simulation. Now computing/writing output...
 AOMC model run complete!
