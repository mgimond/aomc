The most comprehensive published model–model comparison in aquatic optics to date involves seven different models which were developed using different numerical techniques and assumptions (Mobley et al., 1993). Mobley et al. (1993) developed several canonical
problems that differed in the depth and optical characteristics of the aquatic medium. Subsets of these problems (problems 1, 2, 3 and 6) are compared with the AOMC model. 

## Model setup

Standard Configuration used by Mobley et al.  divides the polar angle range ($0 \le \theta \le 180^{\circ}$, or equivalently $-1 \le \mu \le 1$) into 20 bands of uniform cosine width $\Delta\mu = 0.1$. 

* Polar Cap Note: This uniform spacing results in a polar cap (the first and last bins) with a half-angle of roughly $\theta = 25.8^{\circ}$ ($\mu$ from $0.9$ to $1.0$). The paper notes that this $25.8^{\circ}$ cap is **"much larger than one would normally use in computing the nadir or zenith radiances."** Consequently, for some specific runs, the model was adjusted to use a **"slightly different $\mu$ spacing and smaller polar caps"** to improve accuracy near the vertical, but the authors do not give additional details on this.

For azimuthal resolution (phi bins), the model typically uses 24 bands of uniform width $\Delta\phi = 15^{\circ}$

## Mobley et al's Problem 1

Mobley et al.’s (1993) first problem uses a Rayleigh scattering phase function to describe the angular scattering properties of the water. The simulated water body is assumed optically deep and the sun’s zenith angle is 60&deg; with an impinging surface planar
irradiance of 0.5 W m^-2^ nm^-1^ . A single wavelength is assumed for this and all subsequent problems. Two different scattering to absorption ratios are used for this problem: 0.25/1.0 and 9.0/1.0. These ratios result in a scattering albedo $\omega = b/(b+a)$ of 0.2 and 0.9. Mobley et al. present the results of the model comparsions as coefficient of variance ($CV$) which is computed as $CV=\frac{standard\ deviation}{sample\ mean}$.

The results from the AOMC model are compared to Moblet et al.'s mean output using the relative difference ($RD$) computed as $RD=\frac{Mobley - AOMC}{Mobley}$.

## Mobley et al's Problem 2

This problem substitutes the Rayleigh VSF with a VSF typical of waters with high particulate matter. This results in a
strong forward component to the VSF leading to a
probability of forward scatter of around 98%.

Once again, the agreement between this model and Mobley et al.’s model simulations is
very good (Table 4) based on the low RD to CV ratio
(indicating that the AOMC model output falls within
the range of outputs from Mobley et al.’s model suite).
Radiance L(h) values between the AOMC model and
Mobley et al.’s model suite at various polar angles
along the vertical solar plane at two different optical
depths (s¼ 0 and s¼ 20) are compared (Fig. 7). The
polar angle of 0v
represents the direction in which the
photons are traveling straight down—hence simulating
the amount of light energy received by a photo-sensitive detector looking up—and the polar angle of 180v
represents the direction in which the photons are traveling upward (towards the air–water interface). The
agreement in L(h) between both models is quite good
