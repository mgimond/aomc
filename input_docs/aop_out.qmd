The `aop.out` file contains the Apparent Optical Properties (AOPs) computed by the Monte Carlo simulation. The file contains a table of AOPs at various depths. The output is structured in blocks, one for each wavelength defined in `lambbot.inp`. 

The table has the following columns:

*   `depth (m)`: The depth at which the AOPs are calculated. The first `depth = 0` represents the values at the water surface. The second `depth = 0` represents the values just below the air/water interface.
*   `Eu`: Upward planar irradiance. This is the total upward-flowing light energy across a horizontal plane.
*   `Ed`: Downward planar irradiance. This is the total downward-flowing light energy across a horizontal plane.
*   `E`: Net planar irradiance, calculated as `Ed - Eu`.
*   `R*`: Irradiance reflectance, calculated as `Eu / Ed`.
*   `Eou`: Upward scalar irradiance. This is the total upward-flowing light energy from all directions at a point.
*   `Eod`: Downward scalar irradiance. This is the total downward-flowing light energy from all directions at a point.
*   `meancosUP`: Average cosine for upward irradiance, calculated as `Eu / Eou`. It represents the average direction of the upward light field.
*   `meancosDown`: Average cosine for downward irradiance, calculated as `Ed / Eod`. It represents the average direction of the downward light field.
*   `meancos`: Average cosine for the total light field, calculated as `(Ed - Eu) / (Eod + Eou)`.
*   `rd`: Diffuse attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance.
*   `rup`: Diffuse attenuation coefficient for upward irradiance.
*   `Ld`: Downward radiance in the polar direction (0 degrees).
*   `Lu`: Upward radiance in the nadir direction (180 degrees).

Each block of output for a given wavelength is terminated by the line:
