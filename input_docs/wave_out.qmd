title: "wave.out"
---

The `wave.out` file summarizes key optical properties at the surface for each simulated wavelength, making it particularly useful for remote sensing applications.

All AOP arrays (eu, ed, polar_lu, etc.) are normalized upstream by `norma(lam)`. 
When normalized to below‑water downwelling at the interface, `norma(lam)` =  `sum(ed(lam, :, :, k=0)`.
When normalized to above‑water incidence, `norma(lam)` = `cositer(lam)`.

The file contains the following columns:

-   `wavelength`: The wavelength of light
-   `Eu`: Total upwelling planar "irradiance" at the water surface (depth index k=0), already normalized by `norma(lam)`. Units: dimensionless (AOP).
Interpretation: Relative magnitude of upwelling planar flux just below the surface.
-   `Ed`: Total downwelling planar "irradiance" below the water surface, normalized by `norma(lam)`. Units: dimensionless (AOP). Interpretation: Relative magnitude of downwelling planar flux just below the surface.
-   `R`: Remote sensing reflectance, calculated as the ratio of upwelling irradiance to downwelling irradiance (`Eu/Ed`) just below the surface.
-   `Lu`: Upwelling "radiance" just *below* the sea surface. This is the upwelling energy confined to a specific solid angle, often what is measured by a satellite or airborne sensor. Units: dimensionless (AOP proxy). Interpretation: Relative strength of near‑zenith upwelling radiance just below the surface.
-   `Ed(a)`: Total downwelling planar "irradiance" at the water surface, normalized by `norma(lam)`. Units: dimensionless (AOP). Interpretation: Relative magnitude of downwelling planar flux just above the surface.
-   `Lu(a)`:Upwelling "radiance" just *above* the sea surface. This is the upwelling energy confined to a specific solid angle, often what is measured by a satellite or airborne sensor. Units: dimensionless (AOP proxy). Interpretation: Relative strength of near‑zenith upwelling radiance just above the surface.
-   `Einc_max`: Max‑normalized, angle‑aware incident spectrum computed from the Monte Carlo estimator `cositer(lam)=`SUM(cos⁡$\theta_i$)`  where  $\theta_i$ are the angles of incidence of the launched photons for wavelength `lam`. Units: dimensionless (shape only). Interpretation: A clean relative spectrum of the above‑water incident irradiance that includes the angle‑of‑incidence projection. It is normalized so the peak across all wavelengths is 1.0.

### Using `Einc_max` to Obtain Relative Wm^-2^ (or Wm^-2^nm^-1^)

All the AOP columns above are dimensionless (they were normalized by `norma(lam)`). To reconstruct relative physical units, multiply any normalized AOP (except reflectance `R`) by `Einc_max`. `Einc_max` captures the spectral shape and the angle‑of‑incidence projection. It is max‑normalized across wavelengths, so the peak is 1.0.

If needed, users can apply a single global constant $C$ to convert the relative values to absolute Wm^-2^ (or Wm^-2^nm^-1^).
