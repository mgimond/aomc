You should find nine FORTRAN 90 (*.f90) files. The codes are machine independent.

Also included in the zipped files are sample input files "*.inp" to run the model. You may compare the resulting output files "*.out" with the "*.check" files. Don't expect to find a perfect match between your *.out and the *.check files because of the stochastic nature of the model. However, if you use enough photons, you should see a close match.
