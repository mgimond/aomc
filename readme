You should find nine *.f90 files. These codes are written in FORTRAN 90 and will therefore require an appropriate compiler. You can find more information at http://aomc.fugadeideas.org/. The codes are machine independent.

Also included in the zipped files are sample input files "*.inp" to run the model. You may compare the resulting output files "*.out" with the "*.check" files. Don't expect to find a perfect match between your *.out and the *.check files because of the stochastic nature of the model. However, if you use enough photons, you chould see a close match.
