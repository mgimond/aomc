## About the Model

The Aquatic Optics Monte Carlo (AOMC) model is an open-source tool designed to simulate the propagation of light in an optically shallow, vertically heterogeneous aquatic medium. It was originally developed in 2003 using strict FORTRAN 90 standards to ensure broad compatibility across different computing platforms.

The primary motivation behind AOMC was to provide researchers and students with a flexible and transparent tool for exploring radiative transfer theory in aquatic environments. While the model has not been in active development since 2003, its core physics and Monte Carlo engine remain a valuable resource for educational and research purposes.
